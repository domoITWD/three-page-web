  <h3><i>Toyin Ojih Odutola</h3>
    <!--By using the h3 again, I am able to keep the same formatting as 3. This comes in handy when trying to visually create repetition.-->
  <p class="indexText">Toyin Ojih Odutola, 33, began drawing as a way to adjust to the dramatic shifts that came after moving from her native Nigeria to the United States at the age of 5 years old. Creating portraits with a black ballpoint pen,
    Odultola began to discover the limitless possibilities of a single hue and medium, discovering new worlds at her command. In Odutola’s universe, the depth of blackness is without end, the dimensions infinite and unfathomable. “Growing up in
    America as a Black individual,” she told the Huffington Post, “you can walk into any room and your skin is the first read. From this reality, I treat the skin of my subjects as an arena to expose contradictions — to expand and constrict.” And, as
    she deftly illustrates, power and freedom lie in her hands for the taking.</p>

  <h3><i>Juliana Huxtable</h3>
  <p class="indexText">Juliana Huxtable, 30, is easily the most fascinating person in the room. Hailing from a conservative Texas town, Huxtable was born intersex and raised as a boy named Julian. She found her voice in fifth grade by writing short
    stories to deal with abuse and hasn’t stopped creating since. She moved to New York to study at Bard College, graduated, and then began her transition. Huxtable stole the show at the 2015 New Museum Triennial “Surround Audience,” with Vogue
    naming her its star. Now 30, Huxtable has traveled the globe with her innovative approach to art, performance, music, video, and fashion as the co-founder of Shock Value, a New York nightlife project and member of the artist collective House of
    Ladosha.</p>

  <h3><i>Nina Chanel Abney</h3>
  <p class="indexText">Nina Chanel Abney, 36, came out blazing with Class of 2007, a monumental painting from her M.F.A. thesis show at Parsons, depicting her classmates as prisoners on the right, and herself as their white prison guard on the left.
    Abney, the only Black student in her class, told Vanity Fair, “It’s nothing personal.” It’s much deeper than that. Abney understood the impact of the statement she was making and the impact it would have on her career. The work was purchased by
    Miami collectors Donald and Mera Rubell, and included in 30 Americans, an exhibition of contemporary African-American artists which has been touring the U.S. since 2008. Over the past decade, its presence has become increasingly clear, as the
    focus on police brutality and Black Lives Matter movement reveals.</P>
